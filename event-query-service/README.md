# NestJS CQRS Read-Only Application

This NestJS application implements the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern, focusing solely on handling read operations. Queries are constructed based on user requests and processed by query handlers.

## Overview

- **CQRS Pattern**: Separates query (read) operations from command (write) operations.
- **Query Handlers**: Manage and process queries to retrieve data from the database.
- **Read Operations**: Handles data retrieval and querying.

## Features

- **Query Handling**: Processes queries to fetch data from the database.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinguishes between read and write responsibilities.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Optimized for querying and retrieving data.
